# Contact Management System - Database Setup Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the complete Contact Management System database schema in Supabase that perfectly matches the ContactManagement.jsx implementation.

## üóÑÔ∏è Files Included

1. **`contact_management_schema.sql`** - Main schema with table, indexes, security, and sample data
2. **`contact_management_advanced.sql`** - Advanced features, analytics, and maintenance functions
3. **`setup_guide.md`** - This setup guide
4. **`verification_queries.sql`** - Queries to verify the setup

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor

1. Log into your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Create a new query

### Step 2: Execute Main Schema

1. Copy the entire contents of `contact_management_schema.sql`
2. Paste into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute
4. Verify success message appears

**Expected Output:**
```
Contact Management System schema setup completed successfully!
Table: contact_submissions created with 8 sample records
Indexes: 10 indexes created for optimal performance
RLS Policies: 4 security policies enabled
Real-time: Enabled for live updates
Statistics View: contact_submissions_stats available
```

### Step 3: Execute Advanced Features (Optional)

1. Copy the entire contents of `contact_management_advanced.sql`
2. Paste into a new SQL Editor query
3. Click **Run** to execute
4. Verify advanced features are installed

**Expected Output:**
```
Advanced Contact Management features setup completed!
Functions created: search, analytics, maintenance, export
Triggers added: validation, notifications, priority setting
Performance monitoring: views and analysis functions available
Ready for production use with comprehensive feature set
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Run these verification queries to ensure everything is working:

```sql
-- 1. Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'contact_submissions' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Check sample data
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records, 
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'new') as new_count
FROM contact_submissions;

-- 3. Check statistics view
SELECT * FROM contact_submissions_stats;

-- 4. Test search function (if advanced features installed)
SELECT * FROM search_contact_submissions('jewelry', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 5, 0);
```

## üîç Verification Checklist

After setup, verify these features work:

- [ ] Table created with correct structure
- [ ] Sample data inserted (8 records)
- [ ] Indexes created for performance
- [ ] RLS policies enabled and working
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions enabled
- [ ] Statistics view accessible
- [ ] Triggers working (auto-timestamps, priority setting)
- [ ] Advanced functions available (if installed)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Permission denied**
```sql
-- Solution: Ensure you're logged in as project owner or have sufficient permissions
```

**Issue: Table already exists**
```sql
-- Solution: The schema includes DROP statements, but you can manually drop:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS contact_submissions CASCADE;
```

**Issue: RLS policies not working**
```sql
-- Solution: Verify your users table has admin role column:
SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';
```

**Issue: Real-time not working**
```sql
-- Solution: Ensure real-time is enabled:
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE contact_submissions;
```

### Testing Queries

```sql
-- Test insert (should work for anyone)
INSERT INTO contact_submissions (name, email, subject, message) 
VALUES ('Test User', 'test@example.com', 'Test Subject', 'Test message content');

-- Test admin access (should work only for admins)
SELECT * FROM contact_submissions LIMIT 5;

-- Test statistics view
SELECT total_submissions, new_submissions FROM contact_submissions_stats;

-- Test search functionality
SELECT name, email, subject FROM contact_submissions 
WHERE to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || email || ' ' || message) 
@@ plainto_tsquery('english', 'jewelry');
```

## üìä Dashboard Integration

The schema provides these views for admin dashboard:

### Statistics Available
- Total submissions by status
- Time-based metrics (today, week, month)
- Priority breakdown
- Subject category analysis
- Resolution time metrics
- Performance indicators

### Real-time Features
- New submission notifications
- Status change updates
- Live dashboard updates
- Urgent submission alerts

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

```sql
-- Archive old submissions (run monthly)
SELECT archive_old_submissions(365);

-- Clean test data (run as needed)
SELECT cleanup_test_data();

-- Analyze performance (run weekly)
SELECT * FROM analyze_contact_submissions_performance();

-- Update table statistics (run weekly)
ANALYZE contact_submissions;
```

### Backup Recommendations

```sql
-- Export submissions as JSON backup
SELECT export_submissions_json(NULL, '2024-01-01'::timestamptz, NOW());

-- Create table backup
CREATE TABLE contact_submissions_backup AS SELECT * FROM contact_submissions;
```
